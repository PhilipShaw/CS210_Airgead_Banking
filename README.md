# CS210_Airgead_Banking
Description: Code for a compound interest calculator project I worked on in SNHU's 
Computer Science 210.

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving?**

This project is essentially an educational compound interest calculator—created for a 
fictitious bank named "Airgead Banking" as the prompt instructed. It allows users to 
visualize their investment approach based on how much they're able to invest and the 
time frame of their investment. Speaking from personal experience, it's easy to postpone 
investment goals due to a lack of planning and understanding. This simple program helps 
users realize attainable investment goals by inputting a few simple pieces of data.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I believe this project demonstrates my growth in modularizing code, as it uses multiple 
classes, headers and methods/member functions. While there's still a lot of room for 
improvement, this project makes better use of object-oriented programming concepts than 
previous projects I’ve coded.

**Where could you enhance your code?**

I believe that implementing a graphical user interface—GUI—would greatly improve the user 
experience for this program. Also, there are some potential edge-cases that haven't been 
accounted for with its input validation. Regarding modularization, the "DisplayElements" 
class isn't as developed as it should be. As a student programmer, I’m sure there are 
numerous areas where improvements could be made that future experience will illuminate. 

**How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**

Incorporating a GUI would make this program more appealing and user-friendly. Refactoring 
the input validation code using regular expressions would allow more edge cases to be 
accounted for and improve user security. 

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome 
this?**

As I began this course being completely unfamiliar with C++, creating separate header 
files for declarations and then combining them with classes was challenging. This was due
to the seemingly superfluous nature of the task. However, this is supposed to improve the 
performance of programs. Also, the input validation code was more challenging than I'm 
used to because C++ only provides built-in functions to validate each character of user 
input individually—rather than validating full strings. Frequent visits to Stack 
Overflow and lots of trial and error helped me to correct both of these challenges.

**What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**

Stack Overflow and YouTube will remain my primary reference tools. However, I’m 
considering hiring a software development tutor to help me learn more difficult topics 
and guide me through some of the personal projects I have planned this year. Another goal 
of mine is to better utilize the resources provided by Southern New Hampshire University 
and begin participating on freeCodeCamp.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or 
course work?**

Writing this program has helped me to develop some competency in C++ programming, code 
modularization, input validation, adherence to privacy standards and Visual Studio. 
These skills will help to prepare me for future courses and independent projects that I 
have planned.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

The incorporation of multiple classes and headers was a choice made to account for 
future expansion and maintenance of this program. Throughout the coding process, I also 
made a major effort to document my work with comments and provide adequate whitespace.
